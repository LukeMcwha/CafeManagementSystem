# Cafe Management System

## Introduction

This project was built to complete as a University Assignment. The goal is to create a solution to make a Cafe more scalable.

The new system will support a number of features: Table reservations, taking customer orders, informing the kitchen about the orders, informing staff about customers who have waited a long time for their order, customer receipts, handling payments. There will also be an online ordering solution incorporated for takeaway meals. These aspects combined complete the goal of scaling the cafeâ€™s processes to accommodate more customers.

This project has accompanying documentation that describes the structure of the system.

## Documentation

This project is designed using the Model View ViewModel (MVVM). Therefore much of the documentation is split into its separate components; View, Model, ViewModel.
